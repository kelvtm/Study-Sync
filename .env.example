You ran the command wsl --install -d Ubuntu in your Git Bash terminal, which initiated the installation of a native Ubuntu Linux distribution integrated directly into Windows via WSL 2.
Automatic Mount: The Linux environment automatically mounted your Windows C: drive under the path /mnt/c/. This is why, when the Ubuntu shell launched, you were immediately placed inside your Windows project directory:
Action,Command,Notes
Launch Ubuntu,wsl or wsl -d Ubuntu,"Run this from your Windows Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Git Bash."
Launch and Run Specific Command,wsl ubuntu ls -a,Runs a command inside Ubuntu without opening the full shell.
Exit Ubuntu,exit,Closes the current Ubuntu shell session.
Check WSL Status,wsl -l -v,Shows all installed distributions and their running state.

Yu have two main places to store files:LocationPath in UbuntuPerformanceWindows Drive/mnt/c/...Slower. Accessing files here is slow because it requires crossing the Windows/Linux boundary.WSL Filesystem/home/dmin/Faster. This is the native Linux filesystem. Always store code and run tools here for the best performance.Best Practice: Use the following commands to move your project files to the faster WSL filesystem for your Terraform and Kubernetes work:Bash# Go to your home directory in Ubuntu
cd ~

# Move your entire project directory (if it's not too big)
# WARNING: This moves the directory. You might want to copy first.
# cp -r /mnt/c/Users/Admin/Desktop/Study-Sync-Project ~/

🚀 Step 2: Start Your Local Kubernetes Cluster
Run these commands in PowerShell:
powershell# Start Minikube with Docker driver
minikube start --driver=docker --cpus=4 --memory=8192

# Verify cluster is running
kubectl cluster-info

# Check nodes
kubectl get nodes

# Expected output:
# NAME       STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
# minikube   Ready    control-plane   1m    v1.28.3
